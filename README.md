# Petrel Wet-Dry Analysis

Use the markdown file `wetdry_analysis.html` or `wetdry_anaysis.Rmd` to run through the analysis

Make sure you load all the packages and dependencies from `project_settings.R`

Start by unzipping the `original_degs.zip` file to begin with raw files and start at the first chapter of the markdown file.

To start from the downsampling step, start by unzipping the `clipped_degs.zip` file and start at the `Downsampling` chapter in the markdown file.
