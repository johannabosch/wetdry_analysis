# Hidden Markov Modelling (HMM)

## Prep the data

```{r include=FALSE}
source(here::here("project_settings.R"), echo=TRUE)
```

1)  create a single clean data frame containing data for every file

2)  Run a 2state HMMM, have to run the following for the HMM:

    prepData()
    
    define variables:
    stateNames <- dry, wet
    stepPar <- (inital mean for states based on prop_wet)
    anglePar <- (no angle parameter for our analysis)
    
    fitHMM()
    plotSates() - visualize the model


3) test with different binning intervals (2hr, 5hr?)

4) test covariates

  * wetness level (0-20) as a covariate.
  * maybe seasonality or a day/night indicator?
