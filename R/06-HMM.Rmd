# Hidden Markov Modelling (HMM)

Run a 2state HMM on the wetdry data to uncover patterns of wet and dry based on specific states (foraging, resting, migrating).

## Prep the data

```{r include=FALSE}
source(here::here("project_settings.R"), echo=TRUE)
```


To make a data frame that contains:

* a single row per observation (bin time)
* column for bird ID
* columns for response variables: prop_wet, switches
* co-variates: colony, season?, day/night?

1)  create a single clean data frame containing data for every file

2)  Run a 2state HMMM, have to run the following for the HMM:
    ```
    prepData()
    
    define variables:
    stateNames <- dry, wet
    stepPar <- (inital mean for states based on prop_wet)
    anglePar <- (no angle parameter for our analysis)
    
    fitHMM()
    plotSates() - visualize the model
    ```

3) test with different binning intervals

4) test covariates (if seasonality or a day/night indicator)
